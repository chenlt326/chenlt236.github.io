I am a Post-doctoral researcher supervised by Prof. Zhe Wang in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST).

I received my Ph.D. degree (2023) in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at HKUST, supervised by Prof. Jiachuan Yang. I obtained my B.Eng. degree (2019) with a major in Hydrology and Water Resources Engineering at the School of Geography and Planning, Sun Yat-Sen University. 

My research interests lie in land-atmosphere interaction, urban hydroclimate, urban heat island, green building and sustainable development, impact assessment of renewable technology (e.g., PhotoVoltaic panel and Building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) technology), and building energy simulation.
