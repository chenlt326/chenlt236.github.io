I am a Post-doctoral researcher in the Smart Building and Construction Lab, supervised by <a href="https://walterzwang.github.io/" style="text-decoration: none;">Prof. Zhe Wang</a>, in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST).

I completed my Ph.D. degree in 2023 from the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at HKUST, under the guidance of Prof. Jiachuan Yang (Urban Climate Research Group: https://cejcyang.people.ust.hk/index.html). Prior to that, I obtained my B.Eng. degree in 2019 with a major in Hydrology and Water Resources Engineering from the School of Geography and Planning, Sun Yat-Sen University.

With a diverse background in building systems, urban meteorology, and hydrology, my research interests revolve around the fascinating field of land-atmosphere interaction. I am particularly passionate about studying urban hydroclimate, urban heat island, green building and sustainable development, as well as conducting impact assessments of renewable technologies such as PhotoVoltaic panels and Building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) technology. Additionally, I specialize in building energy simulation, contributing to the advancement of energy-efficient building design and assessing the building energy impact on the urban thermal environment.

Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a strong foundation in interdisciplinary research, combining principles from engineering, environmental science, and urban planning. I am dedicated to exploring innovative solutions that address the challenges of urbanization and climate change, with the ultimate goal of creating more sustainable and resilient cities.
