I am a Post-doctoral researcher in the Smart Building and Construction Lab, supervised by <a href="https://walterzwang.github.io/" style="text-decoration: none;">Prof. Zhe Wang</a>, in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST).

I completed my Ph.D. degree in 2023 from the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at HKUST, under the guidance of Prof. Jiachuan Yang (<a href="https://cejcyang.people.ust.hk/index.html" style="text-decoration: none;">Urban Climate Research Group</a>). Prior to that, I obtained my B.Eng. degree in 2019 with a major in Hydrology and Water Resources Engineering from the School of Geography and Planning, Sun Yat-Sen University.

To decarbonize cities, urban renewable technology is a potential solution. I am dedicating to developing a cross-scale urban climate-buildng energy simulation framework to assess the potential and impact of urban renewable technology (details can be found in the Research Page). Specifically, my work focuses on impact assessments of solar technologies such as photovoltaic panels and Building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) technology. With a diverse background in building systems, urban meteorology, and hydrology, my research interests revolve around the fascinating field of land-atmosphere interaction. I am particularly passionate about studying urban hydroclimate, urban heat island, green building and sustainable development. Additionally, I specialize in building energy simulation, contributing to the advancement of energy-efficient building design and assessing the building energy impact on the urban thermal environment.

Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a strong foundation in interdisciplinary research by combining principles from engineering, environmental science, and urban planning. I am dedicated to exploring innovative solutions that address the challenges of urbanization and climate change, with the ultimate goal of creating more sustainable and resilient cities.
