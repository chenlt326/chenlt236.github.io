<h2>Modelling Study</h2>
When city has large-scale implementation of vertical PV facade, their impacts on urban energy balance are unknown. To fill the research gap, a building-integrated photovoltaic parameterization scheme has been developed and incorporated into a building energy model coupled with a single-layer urban canopy model (BEM-SLUCM). This modelling framework facilitates a detailed analysis of indoor-outdoor interactions and assesses the impacts of PV and green strategies on urban climate.

Additionally, a bottom-up physics-based urban scale building energy model is developed to estimate the performance of renewable and energy-efficient strategies from the building to the city scale.
