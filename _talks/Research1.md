======
Climate and energy systems are intricately interacted, influencing and exacerbating each other on both global and local scales.

My research primarily focuses on the performance and impact of various urban heat island mitigation strategies within the fields of urban climate and building energy, leveraging both experimental and simulation methodologies. 
Below is a video introducing the experiment we conducted at HKUST, exploring different rooftop mitigation strategies.

In terms of urban modeling tools, a building-integrated photovoltaic parameterization scheme has been developed and incorporated into a building energy model coupled with a single-layer urban canopy model (BEM-SLUCM). This framework facilitates a detailed analysis of indoor-outdoor interactions and assesses the impacts of PV and green strategies on urban climate.

Additionally, a bottom-up physics-based urban scale building energy model is developed to estimate the performance of renewable and energy-efficient strategies from the building to the city scale.
