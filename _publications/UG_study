Intro: This marked the beginning of my research journey as an undergraduate student, where I focused on studying the patterns of climate extremes and their connection to urbanization. I aimed to understand how human activities impact the distribution of climate extremes over time and space.
I would like to thank my co-authors, particularly my supervisors and teammates, for their unwavering support and invaluable guidance throughout this research journey.
