  <p>During my graduation ceremony in 2023, I had a memorable encounter that I would like to share. 
  <p>One day, when I was waiting for a bus at Hang Hau to campus. A lady approached me, seeking directions to the university. As we conversed, she curiously asked me about my academic level. 
    I mentioned that I was currently a postdoctoral fellow at HKUST. 
    To my surprise, she expressed astonishment and questioned why a girl would pursue such a high level of education.
  <p> I was filled with mixed emotions in that brief moment. 
    It made me realize that in many traditional mindsets, it is often believed that girls should not pursue engineering or attain higher education. 
    However, my experience at HKUST has provided me with an exceptional learning platform. 
    I am immensely grateful for the opportunities extended to me by my supervisors and the unwavering support of my lovely friends and lab mates. 
    In our daily academic pursuits, gender or educational choices are never a cause for concern or hesitation. 
    This realization has reinforced my gratitude for the inclusive environment surrounding me.
