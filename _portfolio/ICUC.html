  <p>I had the honor of attending the ICUC conference and delivering an oral presentation, which was an incredibly exciting and fulfilling experience.</p> 
  </p>During the conference, I had the privilege of meeting many academic idols, which was a rare opportunity for me. Interacting with them, learning about their research perspectives and experiences, was truly inspiring and motivating for me.</p>
  </p>Furthermore, I was delighted to reconnect with old friends from ResearchGate in person at the ICUC conference. Despite our previous virtual interactions, meeting face-to-face created a wonderful sense! We shared our research progress, provided mutual encouragement and support, fostering a strong sense of community and friendship.</p>
  </p>I am grateful to the ICUC conference for providing me with such an opportunity, and I would like to express my appreciation to all those who have supported and encouraged me. I will continue to strive for academic excellence and contribute to the advancement of scientific research.</p>
