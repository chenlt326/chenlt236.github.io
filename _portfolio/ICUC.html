      <p>I had the opportunity of attending the ICUC conference and presenting my research, which was an incredibly exciting and fulfilling experience. Meeting my academic idols during the conference was truly inspiring and motivating. Interacting with them, learning about their research perspectives and experiences, was invaluable.</p> 
      <p>Moreover, reconnecting with old friends from ResearchGate in person at the ICUC conference was a delight. Despite our previous virtual interactions, meeting face-to-face fostered a strong sense of community and friendship. We shared our research progress, offered support and encouragement to each other.</p>
      <p>I am grateful to the ICUC conference for providing me with this opportunity, and I want to express my appreciation to everyone who has supported and encouraged me. I will continue striving for academic excellence and contributing to the advancement of scientific research.</p>
