    <p>I had the opportunity to attend the <a href="https://icuc11.com/" style="text-decoration: none;">11th International Conference on Urban Climate (ICUC)</a> in Sydney and present my research. It was an incredibly exciting and fulfilling experience.</p>
    <p>Meeting my academic idols during the conference was truly inspiring and motivating. Interacting with them and learning about their research perspectives and experiences was invaluable.</p>
    <p>Moreover, reconnecting with old friends from ResearchGate in person at the ICUC conference was a delight. Despite our previous virtual interactions, meeting face-to-face fostered a strong sense of community and friendship. We shared our research progress and offered support and encouragement to each other.</p>
    <p>I am grateful to the ICUC conference for providing me with this valuable opportunity, and I want to express my appreciation to everyone who has supported and encouraged me. I will continue striving for academic excellence and contributing to the advancement of scientific research.</p>
