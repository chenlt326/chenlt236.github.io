<p>Glad to have the opportunity to participate in the <a href="https://cum2023.aconf.cn/" style="text-decoration: none;"> 9th National Urban Meteorological Forum （Chinese: 第九届全国城市气象学术论坛）</a> held by Chinese Meteorological Society in Xiong An, where I presented my research. </p>
<p>This was my first in-person conference in mainland, and it was incredibly rewarding to meet and exchange ideas with many domestic peers. I am honored to have received the Best Paper Award at the forum. </p>
